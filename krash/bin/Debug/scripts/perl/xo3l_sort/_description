This script will convert existing xo3l datalog to the new datalog format

- This will add functional list in the header, the list of functional tests is in the "_funlist" file

- This will convert the functional tests result into a string of 1's and 0's (. and p for ignored tests)
    - The results of multiple tests having the same tname (test name) will be AND'd (Logical AND)

- This will convert values to its base unit mA to A. MHz to Hz

- This will fix the tpdcnt tests having different header. This was not mentioned in the do's and dont's in new logsum format document. But it is recommended that a tname (test name) must be associated to ONLY one test header, if a tname requires a different header, change it to a different tname

- This will change post_fail_bin and pass_bin to bin_result

Example:

    tpdcnt Tpdcnt_val1 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt Tpdcnt_val2 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt Tpdcnt_val3 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt Tpdcnt_val4 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt tpdcnt_min  1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt PASS tpdcnt_min +61.822e+03 2.375 2.375 

Will be converted into
    Tpdcnt_val1 Tpdcnt_val1 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    Tpdcnt_val2 Tpdcnt_val2 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    Tpdcnt_val3 Tpdcnt_val3 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    Tpdcnt_val4 Tpdcnt_val4 1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt_min  tpdcnt_min  1.00 2.375 2.375 
    tpdcnt PASS tpdcnt_min +61.822e+03 2.375 2.375
